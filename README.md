# vellar-sdk

![Vellar](assets/vellar-banner.jpg)

**Passkey smart-wallet SDK for Stellar.** Add passkey login, a Soroban smart
account, and fee-sponsored payments to your app — without handling private keys,
seed phrases, or the low-level submission plumbing.

- **Passkeys, not seed phrases** — WebAuthn (Face ID / Touch ID / security
  keys). Keys live in the device's secure enclave and never leave it.
- **Smart-contract accounts** — each wallet is a Soroban smart wallet, so it
  can carry programmable policies (spending limits, multisig, allowlists).
- **Fee-sponsored** — users hold no XLM for fees; submission is sponsored
  server-side.
- **No key custody, no silent signing** — the SDK never holds secrets and
  never signs without an explicit passkey prompt.
- **Agentic payments (x402)** — pay HTTP-402 resources from the smart account
  with a scoped session key bounded by an on-chain budget: *give your agent a
  budget, not your keys.* See [x402](#x402).

> Status: early. Testnet-ready; mainnet use pending a security review. APIs may
> change before `1.0`.

API reference, wallet methods, policies, and the security model.

## Install

```sh
npm install vellar-sdk @stellar/stellar-sdk
```

## Quick start

You supply three host pieces — a `PasskeyKit` engine, a Soroban token client,
and **your backend** — and the SDK composes them into one wallet handle. The SDK
ships the network config (`TESTNET`) and an HTTP backend client
(`createHttpWalletBackend`), so there's nothing to hand-wire.

```ts
import { PasskeyKit, SACClient } from "passkey-kit";
import {
  createVellarWallet,
  createHttpWalletBackend,
  TESTNET,
} from "vellar-sdk";
import { StrKey } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

const vellar = createVellarWallet({
  network: "testnet",
  appName: "My App",
  kit: new PasskeyKit({
    rpcUrl: TESTNET.rpcUrl,
    networkPassphrase: TESTNET.networkPassphrase,
    walletWasmHash: TESTNET.walletWasmHash,
  }),
  sac: new SACClient({
    rpcUrl: TESTNET.rpcUrl,
    networkPassphrase: TESTNET.networkPassphrase,
  }),
  // Point this at YOUR backend (see "Your backend" below). It holds the
  // relayer/sponsor secrets — the SDK never sees them.
  backend: createHttpWalletBackend("https://api.myapp.com"),
  isValidAddress: (a) =>
    StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey(a) || StrKey.isValidContract(a),
});

// Create a wallet (prompts the passkey once):
const session = await vellar.create({ username: "alice" });
console.log(session.accountId); // C... smart-account address

// …or reconnect an existing one:
await vellar.connect();

// Send a payment — builds + simulates, then prompts the passkey to sign:
const { hash } = await vellar.pay({
  to: "CDEST...",
  amount: 5_0000000n, // 5 XLM, in stroops
  token: {
    contractId: TESTNET.nativeTokenContractId, // XLM
    symbol: "XLM",
    decimals: 7,
  },
});
```

`pay()` simulates **before** the passkey prompt, so failures (e.g. insufficient
balance) surface without asking the user to sign.

Receiving is just as direct — share the address, or a payment request URI:

```ts
const address = vellar.receiveAddress(); // "C..." — display or copy
const uri = vellar.paymentUri({ amount: "5" }); // "web+stellar:pay?destination=C...&amount=5"
```

## Your backend

Submission is fee-sponsored, which requires an OpenZeppelin Relayer API key and
a funded sponsor account. **These are secrets — they must live on your server,
never in the browser.** So the SDK never submits directly: it hands signed
transactions to your backend, which does the sponsored submit.

`createHttpWalletBackend(apiUrl)` speaks to a gateway exposing three routes:

| Route                  | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /wallet/create`  | Submit the deployment tx; store keyId→contract |
| `POST /wallet/connect` | Resolve the smart-account for a known passkey  |
| `POST /wallet/submit`  | Submit an already-signed transaction           |

You run a backend implementing these (holding your relayer/sponsor creds). Your
backend must also allow your app's origin via CORS.

## API

### `createVellarWallet(config): VellarWallet`

Returns a `VellarWallet`:

| Member                       | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `session`                    | The current `WalletSession`, or `null` before create/connect |
| `create({ username? })`      | Register a passkey and create the smart account              |
| `connect()`                  | Reconnect with an existing passkey                           |
| `pay({ to, amount, token })` | Build → simulate → sign → submit; returns `{ hash }`         |
| `receiveAddress()`           | The account's receive address — see [Errors](#errors) below for the getting-started guard |
| `paymentUri(options?)`       | A `web+stellar:pay` payment request URI addressed to this account |
| `policies`                   | Programmable account policies — see [Policies](#policies)   |
| `x402`                       | Agentic payments — pay HTTP-402 resources — see [x402](#x402) |
| `connector` / `payments`     | Lower-level building blocks for custom flows                 |

### Helpers

| Export                         | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createHttpWalletBackend(url)` | An HTTP `backend` client for your gateway — pass straight to the config                  |
| `TESTNET`                      | Testnet config: `rpcUrl`, `networkPassphrase`, `walletWasmHash`, `nativeTokenContractId` |
| `MAINNET` / `mainnetConfig()`  | Mainnet config — see [Mainnet](#mainnet) (two values you must supply)                    |
| `VellarError` and subclasses   | Every error the SDK throws — see [Errors](#errors)                                       |

### Mainnet

> Mainnet use of this SDK is **pending a security review**. Shipping a mainnet
> config does not make mainnet blessed for production.

Two of the four network values cannot be shipped as constants and you must
supply them, so use `mainnetConfig()` rather than `MAINNET` directly:

```ts
import { mainnetConfig } from "vellar-sdk";

const network = mainnetConfig({
  // There is no free public SDF mainnet Soroban RPC — supply your provider.
  rpcUrl: "https://your-mainnet-soroban-rpc.example.com",
  // Verify this against the passkey-kit mainnet deployment manifest for YOUR
  // passkey-kit version. Do not copy the testnet hash on faith.
  walletWasmHash: "…64-char hex hash…",
});
```

`mainnetConfig()` fills the values that are known (the canonical mainnet
passphrase, SDF's public Horizon, and the XLM SAC id — derived and verified in
tests) and throws if `rpcUrl` or `walletWasmHash` is missing or malformed, so a
broken mainnet config can never be built silently. The bare `MAINNET` constant
has those two fields blank on purpose: a blank value fails loudly, a guessed one
fails silently.

### Policies

Attach programmable policies (e.g. an on-chain spending limit) to a wallet.
Pass `apiUrl` (your policy API gateway) in the config to enable
`wallet.policies`:

```ts
const templates = await vellar.policies.listTemplates();
const policy = await vellar.policies.generate(definition); // validate + artifacts
await vellar.policies.simulate(policy.id); // dry-run, no submit
const { contractId } = await vellar.policies.deploy(policy.id); // ONE passkey prompt
```

`deploy()` runs the full attach: your backend deploys the per-user policy
contract instance (sponsor-funded, server-side), the user passkey-signs
`addPolicy` to attach it — the only WebAuthn prompt, no silent signing — and
the completed attach is recorded. It requires a `policyAttach` runtime in the
config wired to your kit (`addPolicy` → sign → submit); without it, read,
generate, and simulate still work and `deploy()` throws a clear error.

Your gateway must expose the policy routes (`/policies/templates`,
`/policies/validate`, `/policies/generate`, `/policies/:id/simulate`,
`/policies/:id/deploy-instance`, `/policies/deploy`) — instance deploys are
funded by **your** sponsor account, server-side.

→ Full guide: [Policies on docs.vellar.xyz](https://docs.vellar.xyz/docs/policies).

### x402

Pay [x402](https://x402.org) (HTTP-402) resources from a Vellar smart account —
the "give your agent a budget, not your keys" flow. `wallet.x402.fetch()` handles
the 402 challenge transparently: it parses the payment requirements, builds and
signs the SEP-41 transfer as a smart-account auth entry, retries with the
`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header, and returns the unlocked response plus the on-chain
settlement.

Pass `x402` config with a **signer** (who pays) and a `simulationSourceAccount`
(any funded classic account, used only to simulate — the facilitator rebuilds the
transaction and pays the fee):

```ts
import { createVellarWallet, createSessionKeySigner } from "vellar-sdk";

const vellar = createVellarWallet({
  /* …network, appName, kit, backend, sac, isValidAddress… */
  x402: {
    // The agent flow: a scoped ed25519 session key signs headlessly.
    signer: createSessionKeySigner({ address: walletCAddress, secretKey: sessionKeySecret }),
    simulationSourceAccount: aFundedGAccount,
  },
});

const { response, paid, settlement } = await vellar.x402.fetch("https://api.example.com/paid", {
  maxAmount: 1_000_000n, // hard per-request ceiling in the asset's base units
  // allowedAssets: [usdcSac],   // optional — restrict which asset(s) you'll pay in
});

if (paid) console.log("settled on-chain:", settlement.transaction);
const data = await response.json(); // the unlocked resource
```

Two signers ship, both satisfying the same `SmartAccountX402Signer` interface:

| Signer | Flow |
| ------ | ---- |
| `createSessionKeySigner({ address, secretKey })` | **Agent** — an ed25519 session key signs headlessly (no passkey prompt). Its authority is bounded on-chain by the spending-limit policy attached to it. |
| `createPasskeyX402Signer({ address, webAuthn })` | **Human** — one passkey prompt per payment. `webAuthn` is a small seam you wire to your passkey ceremony (keeps this SDK free of a passkey-kit dependency). |

> **`maxAmount` is a client-side guard, not the budget.** It stops an
> over-charging server before anything is signed. The durable, enforced budget is
> the **on-chain spending-limit policy** attached to the signing key — for a
> per-token budget, use the token-scoped policy so only that token's transfers
> count. The SDK refuses to sign above `maxAmount`; the chain refuses to settle
> above the policy cap.

Errors are typed: `MaxAmountExceededError`, `DisallowedAssetError`,
`NoUsablePaymentOptionError`, `InvalidRequirementsError`, `PaymentRejectedError`
(the facilitator rejected it — e.g. an over-budget payment blocked by the policy),
and `X402NotConfiguredError` (no `x402` config). Lower-level: `createX402Client`
for a client without the wallet handle.

> **Facilitator note:** a policy-governed payment runs the policy inside
> `__check_auth`, which costs more resource fee than a plain transfer. Hosted
> facilitators cap the fee they sponsor (x402.org's default is 50,000 stroops),
> so a policy-governed payment needs a facilitator configured with a higher
> ceiling (self-hosted, or a hosted one that allows it).

### Advanced

The facade is the paved road. For custom flows the package also exports the
underlying pieces: `createPasskeyKitConnector`, `createPaymentClient`,
`createSessionStore`, `createX402Client` (x402 without the wallet handle) and its
signers (`createSessionKeySigner`, `createPasskeyX402Signer`), the
`WalletConnector` interface, balances helpers (`vellar-sdk/balances`), and
RPC-backed readers (`vellar-sdk/rpc`, imported separately so
`@stellar/stellar-sdk` stays out of bundles that don't read balances).

### Errors

Every error the SDK throws extends `VellarError`, so you can catch broadly or
narrow to a specific class — never string-match `error.message`:

```ts
import { VellarError, WalletNotReadyError, WalletApiError } from "vellar-sdk";

try {
  await vellar.pay({ to, amount, token });
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof WalletNotReadyError) {
    // call create() or connect() first
  } else if (err instanceof WalletApiError) {
    // err.status, err.code — your backend rejected the request
  } else if (err instanceof VellarError) {
    // any other typed SDK failure
  } else {
    throw err; // not ours
  }
}
```
